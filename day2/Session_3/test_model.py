test_model.py — Basic model quality and behavioural tests.

Two things to check after training:
  1. The model meets a minimum accuracy bar on held-out data.
  2. The model makes biological sense (longer petals → virginica).

Run with:
    pytest day2/Session_3/test_model.py -v

Requires: day2/Session_1/train.py to have been run first.
